**My Project**

For the project I chose to take a look at survey data from fivethirtyeight.com. This data surveyed a group of people on flying etiquette - that is, what people think is and is not appropriate to do on a plane. From this survey data, I conducted some classification analyses to determine who will and will not recline their seats on the plane. *THE HORROR! THE PAIN!*

Stored here are all of the files and notebooks I used to conduct these analyses.

1. Within the ***Presentation*** folder is a PDF of my presentation -- warning, explicit language.
2. Within the ***Notebooks*** folder are the Jupyter notebooks I used to conduct my analyses.
   a. The __Analyses__ notebook is where I read in the SQL file, cleaned my data, and ran my analyses.
   b. The __Flask App Data__ notebook is where I organized the data better for my flask app.
3. Within the ***Project Files*** folder are the rest of my files which include:
  - Two image files that are part of my app
  - Two pickle files which hold my X and y data
  - A partridge in a pear tree
  - *Fly_analyzer.py* which is my flask app. This file refers to some of the other files within the folder.
  - *index3.html* - the front page of my flask app
  - *index6.html* - the survey page of my flask app
  - *index9.html* - a D3 visualization I created for my presentation


The end.
